In this article, we will show you how to create a 3D character using DAZ Poser and ContentParadise Megapack. We will use a model of a doll from the Megapack as an example. You can follow the same steps for any other model you like.
 
## Step 1: Launch DAZ Poser and Load a Model
 
First, you need to launch DAZ Poser and create a new document. You will see a blank workspace with a default figure. You can delete this figure by selecting it and pressing the delete key.
 
Next, you need to load a model from the ContentParadise Megapack. You can find the Megapack in the Library tab on the right side of the screen. You can browse through different categories and subcategories to find the model you want. For this example, we will use a model of a doll from the Dolls category.
 
To load a model, simply double-click on its thumbnail in the Library. The model will appear in the workspace. You can use the tools on the left side of the screen to move, rotate, scale, or zoom in and out of the model. You can also use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
 
## Step 2: Customize the Model
 
Once you have loaded a model, you can customize it to your liking. You can change its appearance, pose, expression, clothing, and accessories. You can find different options for customization in the Parameters tab on the right side of the screen.
 
To change the appearance of the model, you can use the Morphs section in the Parameters tab. You can adjust different sliders to change the shape and size of various parts of the model, such as the head, eyes, nose, mouth, body, arms, legs, etc. You can also use presets to apply predefined morphs to the model.
 
To change the pose of the model, you can use the Pose section in the Parameters tab. You can adjust different sliders to bend and twist various parts of the model, such as the neck, spine, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles, etc. You can also use presets to apply predefined poses to the model.
 
To change the expression of the model, you can use the Face section in the Parameters tab. You can adjust different sliders to change the shape and position of various parts of the face, such as the eyebrows, eyelids, eyes, nose, mouth, cheeks, chin, etc. You can also use presets to apply predefined expressions to the model.
 
To change the clothing and accessories of the model, you can use the Props section in the Parameters tab. You can add or remove different items to or from the model, such as hats, glasses, earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, shirts, pants, skirts, dresses, shoes, etc. You can also adjust their position and size using sliders or tools.
