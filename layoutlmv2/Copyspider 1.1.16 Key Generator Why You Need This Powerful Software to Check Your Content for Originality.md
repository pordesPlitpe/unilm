The original products were called Acrobat Reader, Acrobat Exchange and Acrobat Distiller. "Acrobat Exchange" was a program that allowed users to create and edit PDF files, and it was soon renamed simply as "Acrobat". "Acrobat Reader" was a free program that allowed users to view PDF files, and it later became known as "Reader". Between versions 3 and 5, there were no different editions of Acrobat, such as Standard or Professional.[clarification needed] In 1999, Adobe launched the Acrobat.com service, which offered various web-based services that had "Acrobat" in their names, such as Acrobat Connect and Acrobat FormsCentral. However, later on, "Acrobat.com" was no longer used as the umbrella term for the family of services, but rather as the name of one specific service.
