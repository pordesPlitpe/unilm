LWCAD is a software package that offers a variety of tools and features for creating 3D models and designs. LWCAD stands for LightWave CAD, as it was originally developed as a plugin for LightWave 3D, a popular 3D animation software. However, LWCAD has since expanded to support other 3D applications, such as Cinema 4D, Maya, and Blender.
