A product key is a 25-character code that verifies that your copy of Windows is genuine and not used on more devices than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow. You can find your product key on the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker attached to your computer or on the installation disc case. If you bought Windows online, you can find the product key in the confirmation email.
