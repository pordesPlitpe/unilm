PipeMax Pro is based on two separate torque and horsepower models that converge to produce very accurate results. It also features a header design model that can calculate the optimal primary tube length, diameter, and collector size for your engine. PipeMax Pro can also model the effects of different header materials, exhaust gas temperatures, crankcase vacuum, oil pan, oil weight, weather conditions, dyno correction factors, engine friction and pumping losses.
 
PipeMax Pro is compatible with any Windows PC from Win-XP to the latest Windows 10 version. It has a user-friendly interface that allows you to switch easily between metric and English units, access extensive help text for each input box or choice, print professional-looking data reports for every window or screen, use a user notepad to type notes about your engine, and play flash videos and audio files. PipeMax Pro can also open older PipeMax files from previous versions.

If you want to take your engine and header design to the next level, don't miss this opportunity to get PipeMax Pro today. It is the ultimate software for engine enthusiasts, racers, tuners, builders, and designers.
  
But how do you use PipeMax Pro to design and optimize your engine and header system? Here are some tips to get you started:
 
- Know your engine specifications and performance goals. PipeMax Pro requires you to input various parameters about your engine, such as bore, stroke, rod length, compression ratio, cam timing, valve size, port flow, fuel type, etc. You also need to specify your target rpm range, power output, and application. The more accurate and detailed your inputs are, the better PipeMax Pro can calculate the optimal exhaust design for your engine.
- Use the X-Design feature to get a recommended exhaust design. PipeMax Pro has a proprietary software program called X-Design that can calculate the proper sizing of primary tubes, collector and tailpipe from your engine parameters. You can access this feature from the main menu or by pressing F9. X-Design will give you a suggested primary tube length, diameter, and collector size for your engine. You can also see how changing these values will affect your torque and horsepower curves.
- Experiment with different header materials and configurations. PipeMax Pro allows you to choose from different header materials, such as mild steel, stainless steel, Inconel, and titanium. Each material has different properties that affect the exhaust performance, such as thermal conductivity, expansion coefficient, weight, and durability. You can also try different header configurations, such as 4-into-1, 4-2-1 (Tri-Y), 4-2-1-2 (4-2), etc. Each configuration has different effects on the exhaust scavenging and wave tuning.
- Compare your results with your baseline and objectives. PipeMax Pro can generate various graphs and reports that show you how your exhaust design affects your engine performance. You can compare your results with your baseline data and see if you have achieved your objectives. You can also print or save your data reports for future reference or sharing.

PipeMax Pro is a powerful tool that can help you design and optimize your engine and header system. By following these tips, you can make the most of this software and create an exhaust that matches your needs and goals.
