Anthropology is the scientific study of humans, their culture, and their evolution. It explores the similarities and differences among human populations in all periods and in all parts of the world. Anthropology 14th Edition by Carol R. Ember, Melvin Ember, and Peter N. Peregrine is a comprehensive textbook that covers the four main subfields of anthropology: biological anthropology, archaeology, cultural anthropology, and linguistic anthropology. It also includes chapters on applied anthropology, medical anthropology, and global social problems.
 
The book is written in an engaging and accessible style, with numerous examples, illustrations, maps, and boxes that highlight current issues, research frontiers, new perspectives on gender, and applied anthropology. The book reflects recent anthropological research and controversial developments, such as the discovery of new hominid fossils, the debate over human genetic variation and race, the impact of globalization and climate change on human societies, and the ethical dilemmas of anthropological practice. The book also shows how anthropology can help us understand and solve some of the most pressing problems facing humanity today, such as poverty, inequality, violence, disease, and environmental degradation.
