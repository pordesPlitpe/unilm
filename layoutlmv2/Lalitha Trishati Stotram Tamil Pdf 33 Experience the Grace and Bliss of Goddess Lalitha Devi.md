Lalitha Trishati Stotram is a sacred hymn that praises the 300 names and attributes of Goddess Lalitha Devi, the supreme mother of the universe. It is one of the most powerful and secretive stotras of Goddess Lalitha Devi, along with Lalitha Sahasranama Stotram, which contains 1000 names of the goddess. Lalitha Trishati Stotram was revealed by Lord Hayagriva, the incarnation of Lord Vishnu as a horse-headed sage, to Sage Agastya in the Brahmanda Purana.
 
Lalitha Trishati Stotram consists of 15 verses, each containing 20 names of Lalitha Devi. The names are derived from the 15 letters that form the Panchadasi mantra, which is "Ka-aa-ee-la-hrim Ha-sa-ka-ha-la-hrim Sa-ka-la-hrim". This mantra is also known as Sri Vidya mantra, which is the essence of Lalitha Devi's worship. Each name describes a quality or an aspect of Lalitha Devi, such as her beauty, grace, compassion, power, wisdom, and sovereignty.

The 300 names of Lalitha Devi are divided into three groups, each corresponding to a kuta (part) of the Panchadasi mantra. The first group of 100 names starts with the letter Ka and describes the vaagbhava kuta, which represents the power of speech and creation. The second group of 100 names starts with the letter Ha and describes the kamaraja kuta, which represents the power of desire and attraction. The third group of 100 names starts with the letter Sa and describes the shakti kuta, which represents the power of action and manifestation.
 
The meaning of each name reveals a facet of Lalitha Devi's personality, attributes, and deeds. Some of the names are descriptive, such as Kalyani (the auspicious one), Karunamritha Sagara (the ocean of compassion), and Ekananda Chidakrithi (the one who is blissful and conscious). Some of the names are symbolic, such as Kamalakshi (the one who has lotus-like eyes), Hamsavahana (the one who rides on a swan), and Eeswarardhanga Sareera (the one who is half of Lord Shiva). Some of the names are suggestive, such as Kandharpa Vidhya (the one who knows the art of love), Eka Bhoga (the one who enjoys alone), and Hreem Kara Beeja (the one who is the seed syllable Hreem).
 
By chanting Lalitha Trishati Stotram with devotion and understanding, one can invoke the grace and blessings of Lalitha Devi, who is also known as Lalitha Tripura Sundari, the most beautiful goddess in the three worlds. She is also called Sri Vidya, the supreme knowledge that leads to liberation. She is also called Rajarajeshwari, the queen of queens who rules over all creation. She is also called Shodashi, the sixteen-year-old girl who represents the primordial energy.
 
Lalitha Trishati Stotram is a treasure trove of wisdom and power that can transform one's life and destiny. It can also help one to attain various siddhis (supernatural powers) and mukti (liberation) by aligning one's mind, body, and soul with the divine will of Lalitha Devi.
