# Rollcage Stage 2: A Futuristic Racing Game with Gravity-Defying Cars
 
Rollcage Stage 2 is a racing game developed by Attention to Detail and published by Psygnosis for PlayStation and Microsoft Windows in 2000. It is the sequel to Rollcage, which was released in 1999. The game features cars that have wheels larger than the body, allowing them to drive on any surface, even upside down. The game also includes weapons that can be picked up on the track and used against opponents.
 
The game has several modes, such as Arcade, League, Time Attack, Survival, and Scramble. Arcade mode lets the player race on various tracks with different objectives, such as reaching checkpoints, destroying targets, or finishing first. League mode is a career mode where the player can choose from four teams and compete in different championships. Time Attack mode challenges the player to beat their own or other players' records on each track. Survival mode is a last-man-standing mode where the player has to avoid being eliminated by a countdown timer. Scramble mode is a multiplayer mode where up to four players can race against each other on split-screen or online.

Rollcage Stage 2 received positive reviews from critics, who praised its graphics, gameplay, sound, and replay value.

Rollcage Stage 2 is a cult classic among racing game fans, who appreciate its unique concept and fast-paced action. The game has inspired several spiritual successors, such as Firebugs, GRIP: Combat Racing, and Distance.
