The book also contains an introduction that explains the purpose and methodology of the book, as well as some basic information about the Quran, such as its revelation, compilation, preservation, and translation.
 
The book is a valuable contribution to the field of Quranic studies and a helpful guide for anyone who wants to explore the beauty and wisdom of the Quran.

One of the benefits of the book is that it helps to understand the context and connection between different parts of the Quran. For example, the book shows how the first Juz of the Quran begins with Al-Fatihah, which is a summary of the Quran's main themes and a prayer for guidance, and ends with Al-Baqarah 141, which is a declaration of the Muslim identity and mission. Similarly, the book shows how the last Juz of the Quran begins with An-Naba, which is a reminder of the Day of Judgment and its consequences, and ends with An-Nas, which is a protection from the evil influences that may distract or deceive people from the truth.
 
The book also helps to appreciate the diversity and richness of the Quranic style and content. The book shows how the Quran contains different types of surahs, such as Makki (revealed in Makkah) and Madani (revealed in Madinah), Meccan and Medinan, long and short, historical and legislative, narrative and exhortative, etc. The book also shows how the Quran addresses different audiences and situations, such as believers and disbelievers, Jews and Christians, prophets and messengers, individuals and communities, etc. The book also shows how the Quran uses different literary devices and techniques, such as parables and metaphors, oaths and questions, stories and examples, etc.
 
The book is a useful tool for anyone who wants to study or teach the Quran in a systematic and comprehensive way. The book can be used as a reference for finding relevant verses or topics in the Quran, as well as for comparing and contrasting different surahs or rukus. The book can also be used as a curriculum for learning or teaching the Quran in a gradual and progressive manner.
