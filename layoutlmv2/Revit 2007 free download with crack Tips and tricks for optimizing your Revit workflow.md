- Worksharing: You can collaborate with other users on a shared model, and track changes and revisions.
- Schedules: You can generate and update tables of information from the model, such as quantities, materials, and dimensions.
- Views: You can create and annotate different views of the model, such as plans, sections, elevations, perspectives, and renderings.
- Interoperability: You can import and export data from other applications, such as AutoCAD, SketchUp, IFC, and DWG.

However, Revit 2007 is not a free software. You need to purchase a license from Autodesk or an authorized reseller to use it legally. If you download Revit 2007 for free with crack from an unofficial source, you might face some risks and disadvantages, such as:

- Virus infection: The crack file might contain malware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information.
- Lack of support: You will not be able to access the official updates, patches, or technical support from Autodesk.
- Limited functionality: The crack file might not work properly or cause errors and crashes in the software.
- Legal issues: You will be violating the terms of service and the intellectual property rights of Autodesk, which can result in fines or legal actions.

Therefore, we do not recommend downloading Revit 2007 for free with crack. Instead, we suggest you to try one of these alternatives:

- Download a free trial: You can download a 30-day free trial of the latest version of Revit from the official Autodesk website. This will allow you to test the software and its features before buying it.
- Subscribe to Autodesk Education: If you are a student or an educator, you can get access to Revit and other Autodesk products for free for up to three years through the Autodesk Education program. You just need to verify your academic status and create an account.
- Use a free or open source BIM software: There are some other BIM software tools that are free or open source, such as FreeCAD , Blender , BIMx , or BIMserver . They might not have all the features or compatibility of Revit, but they can still help you with your building projects.
