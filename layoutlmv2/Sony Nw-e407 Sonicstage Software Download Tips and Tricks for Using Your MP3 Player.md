# How to Update Sony Nw-e407 Sonicstage Software
 
If you own a Sony Nw-e407 Network Walkmanâ¢ player, you may need to update your Sonicstage software to enjoy the best performance and compatibility. Sonicstage is a music management software that allows you to transfer songs from your computer to your portable player, as well as play and organize your music library. However, some versions of Sonicstage have an issue where tracks cannot be played after transferring a large number of tracks from Sonicstage software Version 3.0/3.1 to the Network Walkmanâ¢ player[^2^]. To fix this problem, you need to download and install the SonicstageÂ® Software Update Utility from Sony's website.
